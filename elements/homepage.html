     <h1>Website Rebrand and more service</h1>

<h2><span style="font-size:17px">Hello, and Welcome, to my Website!</span><span style="font-size:17px"> I hope that you enjoy your stay!</span></h2>
<p>I am in the process of redesigning this very website to include more of my projects, whacky experiments and more!</p>
<p>This includes mine and a few submitted by other folks! If you don't want to miss out, bookmark my website</p>
<p>This doesn't mean I will stop posting to other places, I will just move houses and host all my web-related schenanigans here.</p>
<p>(Damn it's been more than a year since I've posted on my own website)</p>
<h3>In any case, this will be awesome!!!</h3>

<h1>Adding More purpose</h1>

<h2><span style="font-size:17px">Hello, and Welcome, to my Website!</span><span style="font-size:17px"> I hope that you enjoy your stay!</span></h2>
<p>It has been a while since I updated my site to be as it currently stands, and since then I have decided to make this my primary place to give projects a shot and write about longer coding adventures! Currently, I am thinking of maybe implementing some monetisation features onto my page... (It&#39;s quite costly -_-)</p>
<p>I need to update things like the Games section, which still doesn&#39;t host Fakehole Island, which can be found <a href="https://gamejolt.com/games/hellh0le_island/768566">here</a></p>
<p>For some features that were brought onto my site as of now is a little visitor counter. Now this should not be the last thing added, so be sure to check back once in a while :)</p>
<p>Yeah, that sums it up pretty much.</p>
<p>Be sure to write to me problems on Twitter or Game Jolt!</p>
<p>Much Love!</p>

<h1>Rebrand time!</h1>
<h2><span style="font-size: 17px;">Hello and Welcome to the new and improved Flagimtoshi Homepage!</span></h2>
<p>With this fresh coat of paint, I present a better UX for everyone!</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>So&hellip; in the last couple of days, I was very dissatisfied with my current website.</p>
<p>Now I&apos;m finally done renovating it, and it can be seen in all its glory! ^-^</p>
<p>Be sure to write to me problems on Twitter or GameJolt!</p>
<p>Much Love!</p>
